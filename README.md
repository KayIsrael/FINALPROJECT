there is a API stripe payment gateway coded through java script but i had some difficulty in implementing it on the site due to system errors with my personal laptop. As well as the responsive design the maximum it would go to was ipad - due to my software being unable to update VSC etc.

The reasons behind the design was based on the basis of my beauty line that i want to create , which is called KB BEAUTY. It will specialize in natural based products.
